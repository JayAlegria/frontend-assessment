# Simplify Assesment 

## Dependencies

The following dependencies have been added to enhance styling and manage class names efficiently:

- **`sass`** → Used for SCSS support, allowing easy nesting of styles.  
- **`classnames`** → Used for managing conditional class names efficiently.  

## Styling Approach

I use **SCSS modules** to separate design logic from the component itself. Even though styles are managed in separate SCSS files, I have successfully integrated **Tailwind CSS** by using the `@apply` method for utility classes.

I have included my **local `.env` file** in the repository for reference.
